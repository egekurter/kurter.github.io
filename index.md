### Academic Roadmap
I am a doctoral student at [Molinaroli College of Engineering and Computing](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/engineering_and_computing/index.php) of [USC](https://sc.edu/) since early 2023. I am a proud graduate of [METU](https://ce.metu.edu.tr/en). I have both my undergrad and master's diplomas from there.
